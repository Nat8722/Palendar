/* TIPS FOR NATALIE

.WORDS <- indicates a class (i.e class="WORDS"), only affects those in the class
#WORDS <- indicates an id (i.e id="WORDS"), only affects that specific id

.WORDS1,
.WORDS2
{
    All CSS code in here impacts both members of the WORDS1 and WORDS2 classes
}

.WORDS1 .WORDS2
{
    All CSS code in here impacts the WORDS2 class when it is inside of the WORDS1 class
    ex:
    <div class="WORDS1">
        <div class="WORDS2">
        </div>
    </div>
}

^ This works too for ids and can be combined with the commas        */
